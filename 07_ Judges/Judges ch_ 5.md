# Judges 5

**1** ¶ Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,

**2** Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.

**3** Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, [even] I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing [praise] to the LORD God of Israel.

**4** LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.

**5** The mountains melted from before the LORD, [even] that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.

**6** ¶ In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.

**7** [The inhabitants of] the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

**8** They chose new gods; then [was] war in the gates_ was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

**9** My heart [is] toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

**10** Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.

**11** [They that are delivered] from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, [even] the righteous acts [toward the inhabitants] of his villages in Israel_ then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.

**12** ¶ Awake, awake, Deborah_ awake, awake, utter a song_ arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

**13** Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people_ the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.

**14** Out of Ephraim [was there] a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.

**15** And the princes of Issachar [were] with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak_ he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben [there were] great thoughts of heart.

**16** Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben [there were] great searchings of heart.

**17** Gilead abode beyond Jordan_ and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

**18** Zebulun and Naphtali [were] a people [that] jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.

**19** The kings came [and] fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

**20** They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.

**21** The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

**22** Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.

**23** Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.

**24** ¶ Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

**25** He asked water, [and] she gave [him] milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.

**26** She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.

**27** At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down_ at her feet he bowed, he fell_ where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

**28** The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot [so] long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?

**29** Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,

**30** Have they not sped? have they [not] divided the prey; to every man a damsel [or] two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, [meet] for the necks of [them that take] the spoil?

**31** So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD_ but [let] them that love him [be] as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.
