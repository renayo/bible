# Judges 3

**1** ¶ Now these [are] the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, [even] as many [of Israel] as had not known all the wars of Canaan;

**2** Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;

**3** [Namely], five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

**4** And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

**5** And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites_

**6** And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

**7** And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.

**8** ¶ Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia_ and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.

**9** And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, [even] Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

**10** And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war_ and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.

**11** And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.

**12** ¶ And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD_ and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

**13** And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

**14** So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.

**15** But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded_ and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

**16** But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.

**17** And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab_ and Eglon [was] a very fat man.

**18** And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.

**19** But he himself turned again from the quarries that [were] by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king_ who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.

**20** And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of [his] seat.

**21** And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly_

**22** And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.

**23** Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.

**24** When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour [were] locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

**25** And they tarried till they were ashamed_ and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened [them]_ and, behold, their lord [was] fallen down dead on the earth.

**26** And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

**27** And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.

**28** And he said unto them, Follow after me_ for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.

**29** And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

**30** So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.

**31** ¶ And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad_ and he also delivered Israel.
