# Judges 17

**1** ¶ And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name [was] Micah.

**2** And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred [shekels] of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver [is] with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed [be thou] of the LORD, my son.

**3** And when he had restored the eleven hundred [shekels] of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image_ now therefore I will restore it unto thee.

**4** Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred [shekels] of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image_ and they were in the house of Micah.

**5** And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.

**6** In those days [there was] no king in Israel, [but] every man did [that which was] right in his own eyes.

**7** ¶ And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who [was] a Levite, and he sojourned there.

**8** And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find [a place]_ and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.

**9** And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I [am] a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find [a place].

**10** And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten [shekels] of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.

**11** And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.

**12** And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.

**13** Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to [my] priest.
