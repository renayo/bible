# 1 Samuel 9

**1** ¶ Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name [was] Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.

**2** And he had a son, whose name [was] Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly_ and [there was] not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he_ from his shoulders and upward [he was] higher than any of the people.

**3** ¶ And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.

**4** And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found [them] not_ then they passed through the land of Shalim, and [there they were] not_ and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found [them] not.

**5** [And] when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that [was] with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave [caring] for the asses, and take thought for us.

**6** And he said unto him, Behold now, [there is] in this city a man of God, and [he is] an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass_ now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.

**7** Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, [if] we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and [there is] not a present to bring to the man of God_ what have we?

**8** And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver_ [that] will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.

**9** (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer_ for [he that is] now [called] a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

**10** Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God [was].

**11** ¶ [And] as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?

**12** And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you_ make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for [there is] a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place_

**13** As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat_ for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.

**14** And they went up into the city_ [and] when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.

**15** Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,

**16** To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him [to be] captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines_ for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.

**17** And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.

**18** ¶ Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house [is].

**19** And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I [am] the seer_ go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that [is] in thine heart.

**20** And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom [is] all the desire of Israel? [Is it] not on thee, and on all thy father's house?

**21** And Saul answered and said, [Am] not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?

**22** And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which [were] about thirty persons.

**23** And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

**24** And the cook took up the shoulder, and [that] which [was] upon it, and set [it] before Saul. And [Samuel] said, Behold that which is left! set [it] before thee, [and] eat_ for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

**25** And when they were come down from the high place into the city, [Samuel] communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

**26** And they arose early_ and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.

**27** [And] as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.
