# 1 Samuel 19

**1** ¶ And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.

**2** But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David_ and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee_ now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret [place], and hide thyself_

**3** And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou [art], and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.

**4** And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works [have been] to thee-ward very good_

**5** For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel_ thou sawest [it], and didst rejoice_ wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?

**6** And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan_ and Saul sware, [As] the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.

**7** And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.

**8** ¶ And there was war again_ and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.

**9** And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand_ and David played with [his] hand.

**10** And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall_ and David fled, and escaped that night.

**11** ¶ Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning_ and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.

**12** So Michal let David down through a window_ and he went, and fled, and escaped.

**13** And Michal took an image, and laid [it] in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' [hair] for his bolster, and covered [it] with a cloth.

**14** And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He [is] sick.

**15** And Saul sent the messengers [again] to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

**16** And when the messengers were come in, behold, [there was] an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' [hair] for his bolster.

**17** And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?

**18** ¶ So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.

**19** And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David [is] at Naioth in Ramah.

**20** And Saul sent messengers to take David_ and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing [as] appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.

**21** And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.

**22** Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that [is] in Sechu_ and he asked and said, Where [are] Samuel and David? And [one] said, Behold, [they be] at Naioth in Ramah.

**23** And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah_ and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.

**24** And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, [Is] Saul also among the prophets?
