# 1 Samuel 8

**1** ¶ And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.

**2** Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah_ [they were] judges in Beersheba.

**3** And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

**4** ¶ Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,

**5** And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways_ now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.

**6** But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

**7** And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee_ for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.

**8** According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.

**9** Now therefore hearken unto their voice_ howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.

**10** And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.

**11** And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you_ He will take your sons, and appoint [them] for himself, for his chariots, and [to be] his horsemen; and [some] shall run before his chariots.

**12** And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and [will set them] to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.

**13** And he will take your daughters [to be] confectionaries, and [to be] cooks, and [to be] bakers.

**14** And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, [even] the best [of them], and give [them] to his servants.

**15** And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.

**16** And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put [them] to his work.

**17** He will take the tenth of your sheep_ and ye shall be his servants.

**18** And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.

**19** Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;

**20** That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

**21** And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.

**22** And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.
