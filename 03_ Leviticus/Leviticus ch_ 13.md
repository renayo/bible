# Leviticus 13

**1** ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,

**2** When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh [like] the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests_

**3** And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh_ and [when] the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight [be] deeper than the skin of his flesh, it [is] a plague of leprosy_ and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.

**4** If the bright spot [be] white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight [be] not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the plague seven days_

**5** And the priest shall look on him the seventh day_ and, behold, [if] the plague in his sight be at a stay, [and] the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more_

**6** And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day_ and, behold, [if] the plague [be] somewhat dark, [and] the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean_ it [is but] a scab_ and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

**7** But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again_

**8** And [if] the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean_ it [is] a leprosy.

**9** When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;

**10** And the priest shall see [him]_ and, behold, [if] the rising [be] white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and [there be] quick raw flesh in the rising;

**11** It [is] an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up_ for he [is] unclean.

**12** And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of [him that hath] the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

**13** Then the priest shall consider_ and, behold, [if] the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the plague_ it is all turned white_ he [is] clean.

**14** But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

**15** And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean_ [for] the raw flesh [is] unclean_ it [is] a leprosy.

**16** Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;

**17** And the priest shall see him_ and, behold, [if] the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the plague_ he [is] clean.

**18** ¶ The flesh also, in which, [even] in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,

**19** And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;

**20** And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it [be] in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean_ it [is] a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.

**21** But if the priest look on it, and, behold, [there be] no white hairs therein, and [if] it [be] not lower than the skin, but [be] somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days_

**22** And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean_ it [is] a plague.

**23** But if the bright spot stay in his place, [and] spread not, it [is] a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

**24** Or if there be [any] flesh, in the skin whereof [there is] a hot burning, and the quick [flesh] that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

**25** Then the priest shall look upon it_ and, behold, [if] the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it [be in] sight deeper than the skin; it [is] a leprosy broken out of the burning_ wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean_ it [is] the plague of leprosy.

**26** But if the priest look on it, and, behold, [there be] no white hair in the bright spot, and it [be] no lower than the [other] skin, but [be] somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days_

**27** And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day_ [and] if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean_ it [is] the plague of leprosy.

**28** And if the bright spot stay in his place, [and] spread not in the skin, but it [be] somewhat dark; it [is] a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean_ for it [is] an inflammation of the burning.

**29** If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

**30** Then the priest shall see the plague_ and, behold, if it [be] in sight deeper than the skin; [and there be] in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean_ it [is] a dry scall, [even] a leprosy upon the head or beard.

**31** And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it [be] not in sight deeper than the skin, and [that there is] no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the plague of the scall seven days_

**32** And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague_ and, behold, [if] the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall [be] not in sight deeper than the skin;

**33** He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the scall seven days more_

**34** And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall_ and, behold, [if] the scall be not spread in the skin, nor [be] in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean_ and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

**35** But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

**36** Then the priest shall look on him_ and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he [is] unclean.

**37** But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and [that] there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he [is] clean_ and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

**38** ¶ If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, [even] white bright spots;

**39** Then the priest shall look_ and, behold, [if] the bright spots in the skin of their flesh [be] darkish white; it [is] a freckled spot [that] groweth in the skin; he [is] clean.

**40** And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he [is] bald; [yet is] he clean.

**41** And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he [is] forehead bald_ [yet is] he clean.

**42** And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it [is] a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.

**43** Then the priest shall look upon it_ and, behold, [if] the rising of the sore [be] white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

**44** He is a leprous man, he [is] unclean_ the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague [is] in his head.

**45** And the leper in whom the plague [is], his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

**46** All the days wherein the plague [shall be] in him he shall be defiled; he [is] unclean_ he shall dwell alone; without the camp [shall] his habitation [be].

**47** ¶ The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, [whether it be] a woollen garment, or a linen garment;

**48** Whether [it be] in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

**49** And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it [is] a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest_

**50** And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up [it that hath] the plague seven days_

**51** And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day_ if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, [or] in any work that is made of skin; the plague [is] a fretting leprosy; it [is] unclean.

**52** He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is_ for it [is] a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.

**53** And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;

**54** Then the priest shall command that they wash [the thing] wherein the plague [is], and he shall shut it up seven days more_

**55** And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed_ and, behold, [if] the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it [is] unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it [is] fret inward, [whether] it [be] bare within or without.

**56** And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague [be] somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof_

**57** And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it [is] a spreading [plague]_ thou shalt burn that wherein the plague [is] with fire.

**58** And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin [it be], which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.

**59** This [is] the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
