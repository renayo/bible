# 2 Samuel 18

**1** ¶ And David numbered the people that [were] with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.

**2** And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.

**3** But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth_ for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us_ but now [thou art] worth ten thousand of us_ therefore now [it is] better that thou succour us out of the city.

**4** And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.

**5** And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, [Deal] gently for my sake with the young man, [even] with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.

**6** So the people went out into the field against Israel_ and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;

**7** Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand [men].

**8** For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country_ and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

**9** ¶ And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that [was] under him went away.

**10** And a certain man saw [it], and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.

**11** And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest [him], and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten [shekels] of silver, and a girdle.

**12** And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand [shekels] of silver in mine hand, [yet] would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son_ for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none [touch] the young man Absalom.

**13** Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life_ for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against [me].

**14** Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he [was] yet alive in the midst of the oak.

**15** And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.

**16** And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel_ for Joab held back the people.

**17** And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him_ and all Israel fled every one to his tent.

**18** Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which [is] in the king's dale_ for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance_ and he called the pillar after his own name_ and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.

**19** ¶ Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.

**20** And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day_ but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.

**21** Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

**22** Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?

**23** But howsoever, [said he], let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

**24** And David sat between the two gates_ and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.

**25** And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he [be] alone, [there is] tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.

**26** And the watchman saw another man running_ and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold [another] man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

**27** And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He [is] a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

**28** And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed [be] the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

**29** And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and [me] thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what [it was].

**30** And the king said [unto him], Turn aside, [and] stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.

**31** And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king_ for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.

**32** And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do [thee] hurt, be as [that] young man [is].

**33** And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept_ and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
