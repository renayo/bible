# Numbers 1

**1** ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first [day] of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

**48** For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,

**49** Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel_

**50** But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that [belong] to it_ they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.

**51** And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down_ and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up_ and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

**52** And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.

**53** But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel_ and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.

**54** And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
