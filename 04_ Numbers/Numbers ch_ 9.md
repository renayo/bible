# Numbers 9

**1** ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

**2** Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.

**3** In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season_ according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

**4** And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.

**5** And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai_ according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

**6** And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day_ and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day_

**7** And those men said unto him, We [are] defiled by the dead body of a man_ wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?

**8** And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.

**9** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

**10** Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or [be] in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.

**11** The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, [and] eat it with unleavened bread and bitter [herbs].

**12** They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it_ according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.

**13** But the man that [is] clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people_ because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.

**14** And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do_ ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.

**15** ¶ And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, [namely], the tent of the testimony_ and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.

**16** So it was alway_ the cloud covered it [by day], and the appearance of fire by night.

**17** And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed_ and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.

**18** At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched_ as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.

**19** And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.

**20** And [so] it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.

**21** And [so] it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and [that] the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed_ whether [it was] by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

**22** Or [whether it were] two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not_ but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

**23** At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed_ they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
