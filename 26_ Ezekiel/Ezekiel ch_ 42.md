# Ezekiel 42

**1** ¶ Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north_ and he brought me into the chamber that [was] over against the separate place, and which [was] before the building toward the north.

**2** Before the length of an hundred cubits [was] the north door, and the breadth [was] fifty cubits.

**3** Over against the twenty [cubits] which [were] for the inner court, and over against the pavement which [was] for the utter court, [was] gallery against gallery in three [stories].

**4** And before the chambers [was] a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.

**5** Now the upper chambers [were] shorter_ for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.

**6** For they [were] in three [stories], but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts_ therefore [the building] was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.

**7** And the wall that [was] without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof [was] fifty cubits.

**8** For the length of the chambers that [were] in the utter court [was] fifty cubits_ and, lo, before the temple [were] an hundred cubits.

**9** And from under these chambers [was] the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.

**10** The chambers [were] in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.

**11** And the way before them [was] like the appearance of the chambers which [were] toward the north, as long as they, [and] as broad as they_ and all their goings out [were] both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.

**12** And according to the doors of the chambers that [were] toward the south [was] a door in the head of the way, [even] the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.

**13** Then said he unto me, The north chambers [and] the south chambers, which [are] before the separate place, they [be] holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things_ there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place [is] holy.

**14** When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy [place] into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they [are] holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to [those things] which [are] for the people.

**15** ¶ Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect [is] toward the east, and measured it round about.

**16** He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

**17** He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

**18** He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.

**19** He turned about to the west side, [and] measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.

**20** He measured it by the four sides_ it had a wall round about, five hundred [reeds] long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.
