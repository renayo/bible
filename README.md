# bible
As based on the work at https://github.com/JackNathan05/Obsidian-Bible-KJV this repository allows for opening interlinked text of the Bible in [Obsidian](obsidian.md) on Windows.

(I had trouble doing this directly because of the colons in the original file names. Perhaps those work better on Linux. I am not sure.)
